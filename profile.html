						Bardin Goreksson is a Dawi, and one of the five playable Heroes in Vermintide 2.
						In official media, he is usually seen with a large beard, wielding a Hammer and occasionally a
						Shield.
						He may be the shortest in the group of heroes, but the Dwarf Ranger Bardin Goreksson certainly
						makes
						up
						for it in ferocity, determination and spirit.
						Gregarious, prideful and not afraid to offend, Bardin is frequently seen charging into the thick
						of
						battle, axe or hammer in full swing and leaving a trail of Skaven corpses behind him.
						Once the victory is assured, he will be the first back to the pub, roaring and laughing at the
						top
						of
						his lungs in a manner of which only a dwarf is capable.
						Bardin arrived in Ubersreik as part of his journey to discover the lost hold of Karak Zorn.
						After the events of Vermintide, Bardin continues to accompany the rest of the heroes while still
						searching for the lost Dwarven hold.
						Based on which Career the player chooses in-game, he is seen as a Ranger Veteran, honing his
						existing
						Ranger skills, an Ironbreaker, skilled in underground fighting, a Slayer, who has sworn an oath
						to
						only
						die during combat with a great foe, or an Outcast Engineer, armed with an array of experimental
						weaponry.
					</p>
					<p>
						Bardin Goreksson introduced himself to the world as an unstoppable avalanche on the battlefield,
						an
						ale-swigging hurricane at the inn, and a steadfast friend by the campfire. A bulwark of
						comradeliness
						and good cheer, Bardin became the glue binding our unlikely band of heroes.
						Driven by his search for the lost dwarfen hold of Karak Zorn, Bardin has been somewhat
						side-tracked
						by
						the ceaseless Skaven interference. Yet he stays true to his spirit, fighting the good fight as a
						hero
						whose deeds do his ancestors proud! [1]
